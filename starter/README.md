# README GENERATOR


  ## Background

  We are to develop a console node application using inquirer to take input from the user and generate a README.md file which can be used in a project.
  
  ## User Story

  ```text
  
  AS A developer
  I WANT a README generator
  SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
  ```
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  
  Create a command-line application that accepts user input.
  When a user is prompted for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:
      The title of my project
      
      Sections entitled:
      Description
      Table of Contents
      Installation
      Usage
      License
      Contributing
      Tests
      Questions
  
  When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README.
  
  When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines,
  and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, 
  Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
  
  When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license 
  is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License 
  that explains which license the application is covered under.
  
  When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, 
  with a link to their GitHub profile.
  
  When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, 
  with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.
  
  When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
